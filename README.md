CROP ANALYSIS IN ANDHRA PRADESH 

Team Members: Bhavya Gupta, Nishtha Kohli, Vanshika Kathuria, Yash Thakran

The agricultural landscape of India faces challenges in optimizing crop selection and predicting yields to ensure food security and economic sustainability. 
This project addresses this issue through the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically linear regression and random forest, to recommend suitable crops and forecast their yields. 
The integration of Power BI for data visualization enhances the interpretability of the results, providing actionable insights for stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

Methods and Procedures:

1. Data Collection:
The project begins with a comprehensive collection of agricultural data encompassing factors such as soil type, climate, historical crop yields, and other relevant parameters. Data sources include government records, agricultural websites and resources. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure representativeness and reliability.

2. Data Preprocessing:
To enhance the quality of the dataset, extensive preprocessing is performed. This involves handling missing values and normalizing data. The dataset is then partitioned into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

3. Model Selection:
Two machine learning algorithms, linear regression and random forest, are employed to tackle the recommendation and prediction tasks. Linear regression serves as a baseline model, providing simplicity and interpretability, while random forest harnesses the power of ensemble learning to capture complex relationships within the data.

4. Training and Validation:
The models are trained on the historical dataset from 2000 to 2017, and their performance is fine-tuned using validation sets. Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting. The models are evaluated based on metrics such as R-squared to gauge their predictive accuracy.

5. Power BI Visualization:
Power BI is employed for creating interactive and insightful visualizations. The tool allows stakeholders to explore the data visually, aiding in the identification of patterns and trends. Dashboards and reports provide a user-friendly interface for understanding the model recommendations and yield predictions.

6. Summary of Findings:
The application of linear regression and random forest algorithms yields promising results in crop recommendation and yield prediction. The models showcase notable accuracy, with the random forest model outperforming linear regression in handling the complexity of agricultural data. The Power BI visualizations offer a clear understanding of the factors influencing crop selection and yield, empowering farmers and policymakers with actionable insights.

In conclusion, this project presents a comprehensive approach to crop analysis in Andhra Pradesh, leveraging machine learning techniques and data visualization tools. The integration of linear regression, random forest, and Power BI provides a robust framework for making informed decisions in crop planning and resource allocation. The findings of this project contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture, offering a pathway to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability in the region.
